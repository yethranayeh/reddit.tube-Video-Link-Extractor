## [reddit.tube](https://www.reddit.tube "Reddit Tube") Video Link Extractor
 A **Python** script that extracts the video links from [reddit.tube](https://www.reddit.tube "Reddit Tube") from any given subreddit page as long as it exists on the website.


## Required modules
**requests** and **BeautifulSoup** are needed to run this script.

## How to use:
Simply provide the subreddit name to the script and it will create a text file that contains all the video links it finds.

## Notes:
`time.sleep()` is used to prevent the script from making too many requests quickly. It can be changed to make it slower or faster, or it can be removed to run the script as fast as it can.
